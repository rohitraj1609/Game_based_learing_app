# Game_based_learing_app
Creating an Interactive Learning Platform that Combines Gaming Elements with Educational Content to Enhance Motivation, Retention, and Skill Acquisition.
This Game-Based Learning App is designed for college students to practice arithmetic operations through a fun and engaging interface. The application is built using Python and Tkinter and includes features such as a scoring system, leaderboard, timer, and hint system.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to enter their name before starting the game.
- **Arithmetic Questions**: Generates random arithmetic questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- **Scoring System**: Awards points for correct answers (+4) and deducts points for incorrect answers (-1).

## How to Run

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python. If you don't have it, install it using:
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```
3. **Save the Script**: Copy the code into a new file and save it with a `.py` extension, e.g., `game_based_learning_app.py`.
4. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run:
   ```sh
   python game_based_learning_app.py
   ```

## Example

Here's a demonstration of how the application works:

1. Start the application and enter your name.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
3. Solve the arithmetic questions that appear.
4. Use the "Hint" button if you need help.
5. Keep an eye on the timer and try to score as many points as possible.
6. View your score on the leaderboard and see how you compare to others.

Enjoy practicing your arithmetic skills with this interactive game-based learning app!
